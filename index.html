      <h1>Space, a wonderful place</h1>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to our site. Here we have chosen a few interresting
        things that show current missions or pictures from space. Many nowadays
        think that there is not that much activity going on, but we are here to
        show you that there is much happening in space!
      </p>
      <p>
        We have some activities from NASA and SpaceX showing what they are up
        to, like SpaceX launches, or a map showing where the ISS is currently.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope that you will enjoy this site and discover how wonderful space
        is.
